# MTG-OCR-Imagehashing
A self contained jupyter notebook demo showing how Tesseract OCR &amp; Imagehashing can be used to recognize Magic Cards. This demo is a first pass attempt with plenty of room for improvement.


I'm embarking on a project to bring a cheap & effective trading card sorter to market. This was my first attempt at some card recognition code and I've tried to showcase here how poorly it worked. Worry not, I'll be publishing more content with better and faster solutions in the near future! I think it's important to share every step of the process though, even if this code will never actually see the light of day.
