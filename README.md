# MTG-OCR-Imagehashing
A self contained jupyter notebook demo showing how Tesseract OCR &amp; Imagehashing can be used to recognize Magic Cards. This demo is meant to show how slow &amp; inefficient these methods can be.

Howdy! 

I'm embarking on a project to bring a cheap & effective trading card sorter to market. This was my first attempt at some card recognition code, and I've tried to showcase here how poorly it worked. Worry not, I have already found much better and faster solutions! I think it's important to share every step of the process though, even if this work will never actually see the light of day.
